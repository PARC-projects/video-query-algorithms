## How to contribute to the Video Query API

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/fetorres/video-query-algorithms/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/fetorres/video-query-algorithms/issues).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample**
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [Issues](https://github.com/fetorres/video-query-algorithms/issues).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as an [Issue](https://github.com/fetorres/video-query-algorithms/issues).
* It is best you don't start any development until the change has been reviewed by the team and approved first.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Are you ready to submit a PR?**

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/fetorres/video-query-algorithms/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of
what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes
should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
