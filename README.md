# Video Query Algorithms

Home page for Video Query project: **[Video Query Home](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home)**


This respository provides the algorithms and code for:
- building a database of embedded DNN features
from videos,
- brokering requests from the Video Query API to perform searches of the database,
- searching the database for video clips similar to a provided reference, and
- updating the weighted criteria for
selecting matches.

The code and documentation for the Client and API are at

- [Video Query Client](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-client-web)
- [Video Query Api](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api)
