# Video Query Algorithms

This respository provides the algorithms and code for building a database of embedded CNN features
from videos, brokering requests from the Video Query application to perform searches of the database,
searching the database for video clips similar to a provided reference, and updating the weighted criterion for
selecting matches. The code and documentation for the Client and API are at

- [Video Query Client](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query)
- [Video Query Api](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api)

For an overview of the Video Query project please see the reference [TBD arxiv pdf](https://arxiv.org/).
